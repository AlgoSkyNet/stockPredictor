## stockPredictor - Predict stock movement with Machine Learning algorithms

### Introduction
Trading stocks on the stock market is one of the major investment activities. In the past, investors
developed a number of stock analysis method that could help them predict the direction of stock price
movement. Modelling and predicting of equity future price, based on the current financial information
and news, is of enormous use to the investors. Investors want to know whether some stock will rise or
fall over certain period of time. In order to predict how some company, in which investor want to invest,
would perform in future, they developed a number of analysis methods based on current and past
financial data and other information about the company. Financial balance sheets and various ratios
that describe the health of company are the bases of technical analysis that investors undertake to
analyze and predict company’s future stock prize. Predicting the direction of stock price is particularly
important for value investing.

Experienced analysts could apply some mathematical models that are proven based on the past data in
order to evaluate company’s intrinsic value, such as [Graham number](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/graham-number.asp). Graham number and Graham’s
criteria is probably one of the most famous models (Graham, 1949). However, due to the increased
volatility in the current market, it would be probably impossible to find a company that satisfies
Graham’s principles on today’s stock exchanges. Because of these changes, the need for adjusted
models rose. Also, stock market changes over time (Barsky & De Long, 1992; Hendershott & Moulton,
2011). New investment strategies and new technology were introduced, which made some of the old 
models obsolete. Since financial literacy became higher, there are more market players than ever.
However, for some of the old models cannot be easily adopted for the changes in stock market.
